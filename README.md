# Jets Project

## Description

This program prints out a menu for a user to interact with. There is a txt file of 5 differnt kinds of 'jets'. The text file is read into an ArrayList to be used by the menu. The menu lets the user choose to either print out the list of all jets, a list of how long the jets can fly, the fastest jet, the jet with the longest range, and the user can add a jet to the list or take a jet away. 


## Technologies Used

Java, git, Github, w3schools, stack overflow,

## What I Learned

I have gotten better at calling methods from multiple classes and interfaces. I struggled a lot with populating the Jets from the txt file in to an ArrayList. Once I was able to populate the list and learned I had to call the list (to make sure it was available before the user could choose options in the menu) I was able to finish all the other smaller methods.
